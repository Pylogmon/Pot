# Installation

</div>

## Windows

### Install via Winget

```powershell
winget install Pylogmon.pot
```

### Install Manually

1. Download the installation package ending in `.msi` from the Latest [Release](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-desktop/releases/latest) page.
2. Double click the downloaded file to install it.

## MacOS

> I would be very happy if someone could add this software to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Because I don't have a Mac, and I don't know how to do it.

### Install Manually

1. Download the installation package ending in `.dmg` from the Latest [Release](https://github.com/pot-app/pot-desktop/releases/latest) page. (If you are using M1, please download the installation package named `pot_{version}_aarch64.dmg`, otherwise download the installation package named `pot_{version}_x64.dmg`)
2. Double click the downloaded file to install it.

### Troubleshooting

-   "pot" canâ€™t be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

    Click the Cancel button, then go to the Settings -> Privacy and Security page, click the Still Open button, and then click the Open button in the pop-up window. After that, there will be no more pop-up warnings when opening pot.

    If you cannot find the above options in Privacy & Security, or get error prompts such as broken files with Apple Silicon machines. Open Terminal.app and enter the following command (you may need to enter a password halfway through), then restart pot:

    ```bash
    sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/pot.app
    ```

-   If you encounter a permission prompt every time you open it, or if you cannot perform a shortcut translation, please go to Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Supporting Features to remove pot, and then re-add pot.

## Linux

### Debian/Ubuntu

We provide `AppImage` and `deb` packages for Linux.

Please note that: There are two deb package, `universal` is based on `glibc2.28` and `openssl-1.1`, If the regular deb package can't run on your machine due to dependency problems, please download the `universal` package, Due to its low version dependency, it can run on most systems.

Use aur helperï¼š

```bash
yay -S pot-translation
# or
paru -S pot-translation
```

```bash
pot popclip "hello world" # The second parameter is what you want to translate
```

2. Call the pot via the HTTP Request
